Bike Sales Dashboard (Excel Project)

This project presents an interactive Bike Sales Dashboard created using Microsoft Excel.
It analyzes customer demographics, income patterns, commute distances, and purchasing behavior to understand factors influencing bike purchases.

The dashboard includes slicers, charts, and a clean layout to help users explore insights effectively.

Project Overview:

The objective of this project is to visualize and analyze bike purchase trends using a structured dataset.

The dashboard provides insights on:

-Income comparison of customers who purchased a bike vs. those who did not

-Age bracket trends in bike buying

-Commute distances and their relation to purchase decisions

-Impact of marital status, region, and education level

-Interactive filters (slicers) to dynamically explore the data
